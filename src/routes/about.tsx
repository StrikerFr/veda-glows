        Our Mission
      </h2>
      <p>
        VedaGlows combines traditional Ayurvedic wisdom with modern skincare
        practices to create effective herbal skincare solutions. Our goal is to
        provide simple, natural, and affordable skincare products made from
        carefully selected herbal ingredients — so a great routine isn't a luxury,
        it's an everyday ritual.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Every VedaGlows formula is made in India, drawing on herbs and traditions
        that have shaped Indian skincare for generations. We keep our range small,
        our ingredient lists short, and our prices accessible — because real
        skincare should feel honest from the first jar to the last.
